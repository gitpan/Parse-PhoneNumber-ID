=head1 NAME

parse-id-phone - Alias for extract_id_phones(..., max_numbers=>1)->[0]

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.12 of parse-id-phone (from Perl distribution Parse-PhoneNumber-ID), released on 2015-01-03.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % parse-id-phone [options] <text>

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=over

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--default-area-code>=I<s>

When encountering a number without area code, use this.

If you want to extract numbers that doesn't contain area code (e.g. 7123 4567),
you'll need to provide this.


=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display this help message.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--level>=I<i>

How hard should the function extract numbers (1-9).

Default value:

 5

The higher the level, the harder this function will try finding phone numbers,
but the higher the risk of false positives will be. E.g. in text
'123456789012345' with level=5 it will not find a phone number, but with level=9
it might assume, e.g. 1234567890 to be a phone number. Normally leaving level at
default level is fine.


=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--text>=I<s>*

Text containing phone numbers to extract from.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

=back

=head1 FILES

B</etc/parse-id-phone.conf>

B<~/parse-id-phone.conf>

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C parse-id-phone parse-id-phone

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells. Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time, so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete parse-id-phone 'p/*/`parse-id-phone`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.
